## 📌 Abstract

This project develops a digital measurement system for a **non-invasive piezoresistive breath sensor**, enabling precise respiratory monitoring in **point-of-care settings**. The system leverages the **piezoresistive effect** to detect breath-induced deformations through resistance variations.

### Key Innovations:
- Single-reference-voltage architecture reducing complexity and cost  
- Integration of signal conditioning circuits (integrator, comparator, amplifier)  
- Real-time respiratory data processing  
- Novel circuit design inspired by **dual-slope ADC principles**

Validated through **LTspice simulations** and **experimental prototyping**, the system achieves:
- 0.09% nonlinearity under ideal conditions
- 2.1% nonlinearity in practical scenarios

## 🧠 Introduction

Traditional respiratory monitoring often involves **invasive procedures** or **bulky equipment**. Our system addresses these challenges by integrating:

- A **non-invasive piezoresistive sensor** embedded in a breath mask
- A digital measurement system built using:
  - Integrator (OP07)
  - Comparator (OP07)
  - Non-inverting amplifier (OP07)
  - Timer (NE555 monostable multivibrator)
  - Multiplexer (CD4053 as a switch)
- A single **1.2V reference voltage**, simplifying the circuit

> The system converts resistance changes from breathing into digital outputs, enabling **continuous health monitoring** in both clinical and home settings.

*Fig 1: Digital measurement system circuit*

### 🔄 Operational Phases

#### ➤ Signal Acquisition:
- Sensor Rx (323Ω–330Ω) detects breath-induced strain
- Amplifier boosts signal:
  \[
  V_o = \left(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_x}\right) \cdot V_{in}
  \]

#### ➤ Integration & Timing:
- **Ton Phase (V1 = HIGH):**
  - Integrator charges C1 (100nF)
  \[
  V_i(T_{on}) = \left(\frac{V_o}{RC}\right)T_1 + V_i(0)
  \]

- **Toff Phase (V1 = LOW):**
  - Integrator discharges via Vref
  \[
  V_i(T_{on} + T_{off}) = \left(-\frac{V_r}{RC}\right)T_2 + V_i(0)
  \]

#### ➤ Digital Conversion:
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1} \Rightarrow R_1 = R_2\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2 - T_1}\right)
\]

- NE555 timer generates digital pulses proportional to resistance
